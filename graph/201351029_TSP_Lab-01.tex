In this problem, we have to find the graph for which the new vector or mapped vector have the minimum number of zeros.
So, for this we first generate random graph of 6 vertices. As there are many graph having 6 vertices and also different kind of 
graph like complete graph, cyclic etc. Now the graph of 6 vertices will have number of edges from 6(cyclic graph) to 
15(complete graph). So, we are generating the graph having number of edges varying from 6 to 15.


Below is the pseudo code for the above described thing : 
\begin{algorithm}
   \caption{Merge Sort}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\State V = given vector that need to be compressed
	\State gcount =0
	\Comment global count having the record of maximum number of 0's
        \For{$i = 1$ to ${no\_iteration}$}
          \For{$j = 6$ to $15$}
	    
            \State G = RandomGraph(j)
	    \Comment generate random graph having j edges (G = adjacency matrix)
            \If{IsConnected(G)}
	      \State L = laplacian matrix for G
	      \State S = eigen space of G
	      \State U = S*V
	      \Comment Map vector V into eigen space S
	      \State count = \#0's in U vector
	      
	      \If {count > gcount}
		\State gcount = count
		\State ajdm = G
	      \EndIf
            \EndIf
	  \EndFor  
        \EndFor
        \State print gcount
        \State print adjm
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

From this, we can get a adjacency matrix of a connected graph which gives the maximum compression or for which our new vector
will have maximum number of zeros. 
For this, I have used some open source code like to generate random graph and to check whether graph is connected or not.
